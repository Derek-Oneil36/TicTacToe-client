# Tech
As simple as it looks, the Extereme Tic Tac Toe application was built with multiple technologies all depending on one another to function:

* CSS
* HTML5
* BOOTSRAP
* JAVASCRIPT
* CUSTOM GENERAL ASSEMBLY API


# USER STORIES
* I will be able to create an account with my e-mail, password, and password comfirmation.
* I will be able to log into my newly created account.
* Once I'm logged in, the create account and user login fields are replaced with a change password field with three buttons(New game, Get stats, and log out) underneath it.
* I can click on the new game button to start a new game of tic tac toe.
* I can click on get stats to see how many games I'v played.
* I can click on logout to be brought back to the create account and login fields.
* Once I start a new game I can click on the game board and a 'x' will appear on the spot I clicked on as well as a message telling 'o' the next player to go.
* If I click on another spot on the board an 'o' will appear in that spot and a message will appear telling 'x' to go.
* Once I win, lose, or draw, a message will display showing who won, 'x' or 'o', if the game is a draw, as well as tell me to start a new game.
* When I click on the New Game button the game board clears and I can start playing a brand new game.
* Once I had my fill of tic tac toe I can logout using the Log Out button and sign in later to play again.
